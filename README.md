About rtanque
-------------

> What is this? RTanque is a game for ( Ruby ) programmers. Players program the brain of a tank and then send their tank+brain into battle with other tanks. All tanks are otherwise equal.

More details on [the rtanque github repo](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque).

Schedule
-------------

Rounds will be run on Sunday nights, starting May 26, 2013.  We will do a fresh pull of every [bot that has been submitted](#how-to-submit), [divide into divisions](#divisions), and run each division (many times to come up with some average?) and post the results.

We'll have X number of rounds (to be determined) where you can change your code to make your bot better.  Scores will be aggregated over the rounds to determine the division winner.

We're planning on recording videos of some of the matches so that you can watch your bot's performance.  

Bot code will not be made public by default.

Rules
-------------

 * Don't cheat.
 * You can work with someone else.
 * You can submit multiple entries, but they can't collude.

Eligibility
-------------

Participation is limited to the Kansas City based community.  If you work remotely for a Kansas City based company, we'll consider you.  

Divisions
-------------

We are starting with three divisions:
 * Advanced - you use Ruby professionally
 * Beginner - you have Ruby as a hobby
 * New to Ruby - this is the first time you're using Ruby

Divisions will probably employ some sort of promotion and relegation to help competition equalize.  If you have suggestions, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/databasically/kcruby-rtanque/issues) with your idea.

How to submit
-------------

* upload your bot's code to [a private gist](https://gist.github.com)
  * bot filename must end in .rb
* fill (TODO: something...) out with the following information:
  * your name
  * gist ID from above
  * twitter handle
  * division

Results

Coming soon.

Prizes
